Plot file naming convention:

SH = Symplectic (Explicit Euler) Hamiltonian
HE = Hamiltonian Euler
ODE = Ordinary diff eq

H = Energy plot
p = momentum plot
q = coordinate plot
E = Energy for SH plot

e = eccentricity
y = y(0)

1_0 = 1.0

SHEe0_6 = Plot of the energy of the system using the symplectic exlicit euler method using hamiltonian EOM, where initial e = 0.6
